Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way by using a single source of truth, called the "store". Here's a breakdown of how Redux works and an explanation of each hook used in the provided code:

### How Redux Works
1. *Store*: The single source of truth that holds the state of your application.
2. *Actions*: Plain objects that describe what happened or what should change in the state.
3. *Reducers*: Functions that take the current state and an action, and return a new state.
4. *Dispatch*: A method to send actions to the store.
5. *Selectors*: Functions to get specific pieces of state from the store.

### Explanation of Each Hook in the Provided Code

1. *createStore*
 ```  typescript
   import { createStore } from 'redux';
 ```
 
   - Creates a Redux store that holds the state tree of your application. Only one store should exist in a Redux app.

2. *combineReducers*
  ``` typescript
   import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
  ```
   - Combines multiple reducer functions into a single reducer function. The rootReducer maps reducer functions to slices of state.

3. *Provider*
 ```  typescript
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
   ```
   - Makes the Redux store available to any nested components that have been wrapped in the connect function. This is essential for integrating Redux with React.

4. *createRoot*
  ``` typescript
   import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
 ```  
   - Initialises the root of the React application. This is part of React and not Redux, used to render the React component tree.

### Code Breakdown
``` typescript
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import App from './App.tsx'
import authReducer from './redux/auth-reducer.ts'
import './index.scss'

// Combine reducers to form the root reducer
const rootReducer = combineReducers({ auth: authReducer })

// Create the Redux store with the root reducer
const store = createStore(rootReducer)

// Render the React component tree, providing the Redux store
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
)

```

### Explanation of Each Line

- *createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!)*: Initializes the root of the React application.
- *render(...)*: Renders the React component tree.
- *<Provider store={store}>*: Makes the Redux store available to the App component and its descendants.
- *<App />*: The main React component of the application.
- *combineReducers({ auth: authReducer })*: Combines multiple reducers into a single root reducer.
- *createStore(rootReducer)*: Creates the Redux store with the root reducer.

This setup initializes Redux in a React application, sets up the Redux store, and connects it to the React component tree using the ***Provider*** component.
